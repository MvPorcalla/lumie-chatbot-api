🧠 updateContext() doesn't track history or reentry
If a user accidentally switches context, there's no mechanism to re-enter the previous one.

✅ Optional improvement:

Store a simple context history in the session (e.g., session.previousContexts = [])

Then allow fallback to previous if desired later (UX-based).

IMPORTANT:
Modularize the Code : separate all the functions to separate files to organize

Here’s a list of **practical future improvements** you can tackle, broken into categories:

---

## 🧠 Chatbot Intelligence

1. **✅ Intent Confidence Tuning UI**

   * Build a small frontend to test and adjust `fuzzyThreshold` and `fuzzyScoreLimit` live.
   * Useful for tuning responses without restarting the server.

2. **🤖 Multi-turn Conversations**

   * Allow intents to have a `requiresFollowUp` or `nextStepIntent` field.
   * Track the flow of questions (e.g., ordering flow: "pizza size" → "toppings" → "confirmation").

3. **🔁 Learn From Misses**

   * Log unrecognized inputs (`None`) and export them.
   * Admin panel to tag them and turn them into new training data.

---

## ⚙️ Architecture & Maintenance

4. **🪄 Move Data Loading Into a Module**

   * Move training data loading to `./lib/loadTrainingData.js`.
   * Makes testing easier and server.js cleaner.

5. **📦 Export Logs as JSON**

   * Option to export log entries in structured JSON instead of plain text for better analysis.

6. **🌐 Swagger or Postman Docs**

   * Add `swagger-ui-express` to generate API documentation.
   * Useful for onboarding devs or debugging.

---

## 🧪 Developer UX

7. **📈 Add Chat Metrics Endpoint**

   * `/api/metrics` that returns:

     * Total requests today
     * Number of "None" fallbacks
     * Most triggered intents
     * Most active users (by IP or userId)

8. **🧼 Better Log Rotation**

   * Use something like `winston` or `rotating-file-stream` for auto-archiving logs after a certain size or date.

---

## 📁 Data & Admin Features

9. **🧠 Editable Training Dashboard**

   * Admin UI to:

     * View/edit intents
     * Add examples
     * Rebuild Fuse indexes
     * Deploy updates without restarting server

10. **🔒 Auth Middleware**

* Protect endpoints like `/debug-log` or future `/admin/*` routes with API key or token.

---

## ✨ Enhancements to Chat Output

11. **🗂️ Reply Variants by Tone**

* Add tone tags to answers: `{ tone: "casual", answer: "Sure thing!" }`.
* Support user input like "say that professionally".

12. **📷 Media Attachments**

* Support responses with images, links, or markdown.

---

## 🧪 Advanced (Stretch)

13. **💬 Streaming Response Support**

* For future LLM integration, support Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSocket streaming.

14. **📦 Plugin-Like Intents**

* Let intents call external APIs or functions (e.g., weather, search, calendar).

15. **🧠 Switchable Matching Algorithms**

* Allow toggling between Fuse.js and other libraries like `natural`, `fast-fuzzy`, or even embedding-based search for high accuracy.
